  {
    question: "A stakeholder repeatedly interrupts Sprint Reviews with last-minute change requests. What is the Scrum Master's best response?",
    options: [
      "Allow the changes to be considered immediately",
      "Remind stakeholders of the Sprint boundary and review purpose",
      "Coach the Product Owner to manage stakeholder expectations",
      "Cancel the review until the stakeholder agrees to the format"
    ],
    correct: [1, 2],
    type: "multi",
    explanation: "B and C demonstrate the Scrum Master’s coaching and facilitation role. A undermines the Sprint boundary, and D is too extreme."
  },
  {
    question: "True or False: The Scrum Master is responsible for the team's delivery velocity.",
    options: ["True", "False"],
    correct: 1,
    type: "boolean",
    explanation: "The Scrum Master facilitates continuous improvement but does not manage velocity, which is a metric owned by the Developers."
  },
  {
    question: "During a Retrospective, team members are reluctant to speak. What should the Scrum Master do?",
    options: [
      "Introduce anonymous feedback tools",
      "End the session early",
      "Use facilitation techniques to create psychological safety",
      "Report the team’s silence to upper management"
    ],
    correct: [0, 2],
    type: "multi",
    explanation: "Anonymous input and improved facilitation build trust. Ending early avoids the issue, and escalating undermines team autonomy."

  // New questions...
  {
    question: "A Scrum Master notices that the team is consistently missing Sprint Goals. What should they do first?",
    options: [
      "Increase the Sprint duration",
      "Analyze the team's velocity trends",
      "Encourage the team to commit to fewer items",
      "Replace underperforming team members"
    ],
    correct: [1, 2],
    type: "multi",
    explanation: "Examining velocity trends and adjusting commitments helps improve predictability. Changing Sprint duration or replacing members is not ideal."
  },
  {
    question: "True or False: The Scrum Master should assign tasks to Developers.",
    options: ["True", "False"],
    correct: 1,
    type: "boolean",
    explanation: "Developers self-organize and decide how to complete work. The Scrum Master facilitates but does not assign tasks."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following are valid ways to improve Sprint Planning?",
    options: [
      "Ensure backlog refinement is done beforehand",
      "Limit discussions to 15 minutes",
      "Encourage Developers to estimate collaboratively",
      "Allow only the Product Owner to decide Sprint scope"
    ],
    correct: [0, 2],
    type: "multi",
    explanation: "Refinement and collaborative estimation improve planning. Rushing discussions or limiting decision-making contradict Scrum principles."
  },
  {
    question: "A stakeholder demands daily progress reports from the Scrum Team. What should the Scrum Master do?",
    options: [
      "Provide reports as requested",
      "Encourage stakeholders to attend Daily Scrum",
      "Explain the purpose of Sprint Reviews",
      "Ignore the request"
    ],
    correct: [1, 2],
    type: "multi",
    explanation: "Stakeholders should engage through Scrum events rather than imposing reporting overhead."
